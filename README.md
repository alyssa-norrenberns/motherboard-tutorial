> The motherboard is the computer's main circuit board. It's a thin plate that holds the CPU, memory, connectors for the hard drive and optical drives, expansion cards to control the video and audio, and connections to your computer's ports (such as USB ports). The motherboard connects directly or indirectly to every part of the computer.

Essentially, the motherboard is a piece of computer ***hardware*** that is made to hold and connect other computer hardware componenets. 

### What is hardware?

***Hardware*** is a term for physical, tangible computer parts, such as keyboards and hard drives.   

This is different from ***software***, which are computer parts you cannot see or touch that give instructions to hardware (e.g. computer programs and apps).

### How do other hardware components connect to the motherboard?

get info from article describing slots / sockets / etc.

## Motherboard components

add brief description regarding components.

**This tutorial will cover the following components:**
1. Central Processing Unit (CPU) 
2. Random Access Memory (RAM) 
3. TBD

### Central Processing Unit (CPU)

*Pictured above: Sketch depiction of a CPU*

> The central processing unit (CPU), also called a processor, is located inside the computer case on the motherboard. It is sometimes called the brain of the computer, and its job is to carry out commands.

**How does this connect to the motherboard?**

Specify slot / socket / etc.

### Random Access Memory (RAM)

> RAM is your system's short-term memory. Whenever your computer performs calculations, it temporarily stores the data in the RAM until it is needed.
