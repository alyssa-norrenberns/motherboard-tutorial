## What is a motherboard?

**Here's a comprehensive definition:**

> The motherboard is the computer's main circuit board. It's a thin plate that holds the CPU, memory, connectors for the hard drive and optical drives, expansion cards to control the video and audio, and connections to your computer's ports (such as USB ports). The motherboard connects directly or indirectly to every part of the computer.[^1]

Essentially, the motherboard is a piece of computer ***hardware*** that is made to hold and connect other computer hardware componenets.[^2]

## How do other hardware components connect to the motherboard?

This tutorial will cover 3 main motherboard parts that connect external hardware components:
1. Slots
2. Sockets
3. Connections

### Slots

> Slots accommodate hardware components using raised ports. Depending on the age of your motherboard, the major slots present in a motherboard are AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port), PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect), and RAM (Randon Access Memory).[^3]

### Sockets

> Sockets allow users to install component pieces directly into the motherboard. The CPU socket is the most notable example.[^3]

### Connections 

> Connections provide power via your power supply to your component parts. These connections are often pin connections, some of which are placed in raised sockets (via ATX connectors), while others are bare.[^3]

## What's next?

Learn about the hardware connected to the motherboard via these parts on the [Motherboard Components](/motherboard-components.md) page.
