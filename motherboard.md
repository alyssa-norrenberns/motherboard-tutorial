> The motherboard is the computer's main circuit board. It's a thin plate that holds the CPU, memory, connectors for the hard drive and optical drives, expansion cards to control the video and audio, and connections to your computer's ports (such as USB ports). The motherboard connects directly or indirectly to every part of the computer.[^1]

Essentially, the motherboard is a piece of computer ***hardware*** that is made to hold and connect other computer hardware componenets.[^1]
