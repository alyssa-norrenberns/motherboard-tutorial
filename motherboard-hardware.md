# Hardware Components on the Motherbaord

[Return to README](/README.md)

As stated on the [Motherboards for Beginners](/motherboard.md) page, motherboards hold and connect other hardware components.

**This page will cover the following components:**
1. Central Processing Unit (CPU) 
2. Random Access Memory (RAM) 
3. Hard Drive
4. Power Supply Unit
5. Expansion Cards

## Central Processing Unit (CPU)

*Pictured above: Sketch depiction of a CPU*

**Here's a comprehensive definition:**

> The central processing unit (CPU), also called a processor, is located inside the computer case on the motherboard. It is sometimes called the brain of the computer, and its job is to carry out commands.[^1]

**How does this connect to the motherboard?**

The CPU connects to the motherboard via a specialized ***socket*** called the CPU socket.[^1]

## Random Access Memory (RAM)

*Pictured above: Sketch depiction of RAM*

**Here's a comprehensive definition:**

> RAM is your system's short-term memory. Whenever your computer performs calculations, it temporarily stores the data in the RAM until it is needed.[^1]

**How does this connect to the motherboard?**

RAM connects to the motherboard via specialized ***slots*** called DIMM slots.[^2]

## Hard Drive

*Pictured above: Sketch depiction of a hard disk drive (HDD) next to a solid-state drive (SSD)*

**Here's a comprehensive definition:**

> The hard drive is where your software, documents, and other files are stored. The hard drive is long-term storage, which means the data is still saved even if you turn the computer off or unplug it.

HDDs and SSDs are the 2 most common types of hard drive. They have the same function but differ in design.[^3] If you want to learn more, [read this article about types of hard drives](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/types-of-hard-drives-sata-pata-scsi-and-more-2/#:~:text=Currently%2C%20there%20are%20two%20common,Solid%20State%20Drive%20(SSD)).

**How does this connect to the motherboard?**

Hard drives (both HDDs and SSDs) connect to the motherboard via specialized ***connectors*** called SATA connectors.[^2]

## Power Supply Unit

*Pictured above: Sketch depiction of a power supply unit*


**Here's a comprehensive definition:**

> The power supply unit in a computer converts the power from the wall outlet to the type of power needed by the computer. It sends power through cables to the motherboard and other components.

**How does this connect to the motherboard?**

The power supply unit connects to the motherboard via specialized ***connections*** called power connectors.[^2]

## Expansion Cards

![Expansion card](https://media.gcflearnfree.org/content/55e073157dd48174331f5168_01_17_2014/Inside_video-card-02.jpg "Expansion card")

*Pictured above: Sketch depiction of a video card, one type of expansion card*

There are many types of expansion cards with varying purposes. Another name for them is PCI (peripheral component interconnect) cards. Since most motherboards have built-in features, expansion cards are usually optional add-ons to enhance computer performance capabilities.[^1]

**How does this connect to the motherboard?**

Expansion cards connect to the motherboard via specialized ***slots*** called expansion slots or PCI slots.[^1] [^2]

### Common types of expansion cards

| Name    | Definition |
| -------- | ------- |
| Video card  | The video card is responsible for what you see on the monitor. Most computers have a GPU (graphics processing unit) built into the motherboard instead of having a separate video card. If you like playing graphics-intensive games, you can add a faster video card to one of the expansion slots to get better performance.[^1] These are also referred to as *graphics* cards.    |
| Sound card | The sound card—also called an audio card—is responsible for what you hear in the speakers or headphones. Most motherboards have integrated sound, but you can upgrade to a dedicated sound card for higher-quality sound.[^1]     |
| Network card    | The network card allows your computer to communicate over a network and access the Internet. It can either connect with an Ethernet cable or through a wireless connection (often called Wi-Fi). Many motherboards have built-in network connections.[^1]    |

## That's all folks!
