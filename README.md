> The motherboard serves as a single platform to connect all of the parts of a computer together. It connects the CPU, memory, hard drives, optical drives, video card, sound card, and other ports and expansion cards directly or via cables. It can be considered as the backbone of a computer.

Essentially, the motherboard is a piece of computer ***hardware*** that is made to hold and connect other computer hardware componenets. 

### What is hardware?

***Hardware*** is a term for physical, tangible computer parts, such as keyboards and hard drives.   

This is different from ***software***, which are computer parts you cannot see or touch that give instructions to hardware (e.g. computer programs and apps).
